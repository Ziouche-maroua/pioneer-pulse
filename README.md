# PioneerPulse

PioneerPulse is a lightweight, open-source distributed system monitoring platform inspired by tools like Grafana.

The goal of this project is not feature completeness, but **deep understanding and implementation of core backend architecture concepts**, including:

- CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)
- Read / Write database splitting
- Eventual consistency
- System observability fundamentals

This project is developed by the **Pioneers** team as part of the *Build IT* technical event.

## Why PioneerPulse?

Modern systems generate massive amounts of operational data (metrics, logs, events).  
PioneerPulse explores how such data can be ingested, stored, and queried efficiently using **real-world backend patterns**.
