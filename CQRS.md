# CQRS: Command Query Responsibility Segregation

**CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)** is an architectural design pattern that separates **read** and **write** operations for a data store into **distinct models**.

Instead of using a single model to handle all responsibilities, CQRS divides the system into two clear parts:

- **Commands**: actions that *change* state (create, update, delete)
- **Queries**: requests that *read* data without modifying it

This separation allows each side to be optimized independently, leading to better **performance**, **scalability**, and **maintainability**, especially in systems with complex business logic and high traffic.

---

## Background Concepts

### why use CQRS and not a simple CRUD ?

A traditional **C**reate, **R**ead, **U**pdate, **D**elete (CRUD) application uses a **single data model** for both reading and writing. This approach works well for simple applications. However, as the system grows in complexity, several issues arise:

- The same model serves **conflicting purposes**
  - Normalized for writes
  - Denormalized for reads
- Read and write operations compete for the **same resources**
- Reads cannot be scaled independently from writes
- Business logic becomes tightly coupled with data access logic
- Performance bottlenecks appear when read/write patterns differ significantly

As a result, the system becomes harder to evolve and maintain.

---

## Core Architecture of CQRS

CQRS addresses these limitations by clearly separating responsibilities.

### Command Side (Write Model)

The **command side** is responsible for all state changes.

- Handles create, update, and delete operations
- Enforces business rules and invariants
- Executes domain logic
- Publishes domain events
- Optimized for **consistency and correctness**

Commands do **not** return data. They only indicate success or failure.

---

### Query Side (Read Model)

The **query side** focuses exclusively on data retrieval.

- Handles all read operations
- Optimized for specific use cases and views
- Often denormalized for fast reads
- Can use a different database or storage technology
- Usually **eventually consistent**

Queries never change state.

---

### Synchronization Layer

Because the read and write models are separate, they must be synchronized.

This is typically achieved using:

- Domain events
- Event buses or message queues
- Projection handlers that update read models

This layer reacts to events emitted by the command side and updates the query side accordingly.

## when to use crqs and when not : 

Use CQRS when:

- You have complex domain logic
- You need to scale reads independently
- Different consumers require different data views
- You are building an event-driven system

Avoid CQRS when:
- The application is simple
- Strong consistency is required everywhere

## Command Validation & Processing Lifecycle :
Before a command is executed, it must be validated.

Types of Validation :

1️) Structural validation

- Fields exist?
- Types correct?
- Format valid?

2️) Business validation 

- Rules respected?
- Constraints valid?
- Domain invariant safe?

3️) Authorization

- Does the user have permission?

4️) Idempotency
- Prevents processing duplicate commands.

  
## Synchronous vs Asynchronous Commands :

### Synchronous

Use when:

- Operation is fast.
- Deterministic.
- User expects instant confirmation.

Client receives:
✅ success / ❌ failure immediately

### Asynchronous

Use when:

- Operation is long-running.
- Heavy logic.
- Multiple systems involved.

Client receives:
📨 Command Accepted
Then:
- Poll status.
or
- Receive WebSocket push.
or
- Receive email/notification.
  
## Consistency & Eventual Consistency :

After a successful command, reads may lag.
This is acceptable in CQRS.

### To Handle UX

- “Processing…” indicators.
- Disable buttons.
- Async refresh.
- Status pages.

  
## Events, Messaging & Synchronization :

CQRS heavily relies on events.
### Types of Events

- Domain Events.
- Integration Events.
  
### Infrastructure

- Kafka.
- RabbitMQ.
- Redis Streams.
- Simple in-memory queues (for demos).

### Reliability

- Retry policies.
- Dead letter queues.
- At-least-once delivery reality.
  
## Error Handling Strategy :

### Command Failure

- Return structured error.
- Do not emit event.
- Rollback / maintain integrity.

### Projection Failure

-Retry.
-Store failed events.
-Replay event stream.


## Observability & Monitoring : 

To be production-ready, monitor:

### Metrics

- Command success rate.
- Event processing latency.
- Throughput.
- Projection health.

### Tools

- OpenTelemetry.
- Prometheus + Grafana.
- Jaeger Tracing.

## Security & Authorization :

Security = mandatory.

- Authorization happens BEFORE command execution.
- Never trust read model to secure data.
- Secure event bus.
- Mask sensitive payloads.

  
## Common Pitfalls & Misconceptions :


- CQRS ≠ Event Sourcing.
- CQRS ≠ Microservices only.
- CQRS is NOT always needed.
- Debugging becomes harder.
- Infrastructure complexity increases.
- Requires discipline.

## Implementation Roadmap :

If building a CQRS app:

1️- Define domain.

2️- Separate read vs write APIs.

3️- Implement command handlers.

4️- Add validation + business rules.

5️- Emit events.

6️- Build read projections.

7️- Handle consistency.

8️- Add monitoring.

9️- Load test & scale. 

## When NOT to Use CQRS :


- Simple CRUD apps.
- Systems requiring immediate strong consistency.
- Early MVPs / prototypes.
- Teams without architecture discipline.
- Low traffic / small-scale systems.
- Systems requiring very simple debugging.
